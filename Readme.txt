HIERATIC ATTACK

Well, defending a hut against the assembled forces of the inexplicably angry gods might not be what you expected when you signed up for this whole ruling Egypt gig, but it's all in a day's work for a pharoah...right?

Build and upgrade towers to make sure those silly peasants have another day to serve you! Use the nimbleness of your fingers to craft out mystical hieroglyphs to imbue your towers with even more power!
